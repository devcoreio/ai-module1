- Suggest how to structure the code for maintainability and scalability
- Include patterns for error handling, validation, and logging

### 4. API Design
- Define the REST endpoints needed for password strength checking
- Suggest request/response formats
- Include validation rules and error responses

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Propose unit testing and integration testing approaches
- Suggest test coverage requirements
- Include performance testing considerations

## Critical Requirements
- **STRICT ADHERENCE**: The implementation plan must follow ALL details provided in this document
- **NO ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCIES**: Do not suggest any dependencies beyond what's necessary for the core functionality without approval
- **GO BEST PRACTICES**: Ensure the plan follows Go coding standards and conventions

## Additional Information Needed
If you need more specific details about:
- Password strength criteria or algorithms
- Authentication requirements
- Performance requirements
- Deployment considerations
- Integration requirements

Please ask for clarification before proceeding with the plan.

Please provide a comprehensive implementation plan that can be used to guide the actual development of this Password Strength Checker API.
