Create an implementation plan for ai to create a frontend user web interface that allows the user to use the functionality of the api contained within `@config-service` folder.

- Figure out the endpoints available by searching through `@config-service` folder
- All code should either be TypeScript, HTML, or Tailwind CSS. Do not use Javascript directly.
- DO not take any external dependencies, such as React and Vue, and use the web components functionalisy built into the browser.
-  Automated testing is very important so ensure the plan includes unit testing
- Ensure the layout is simple and clean, it should convey trust and signal to the user visually and the functionality. The user should be able to toggle whether to show password or not on
- Ensure the design is a modern web 3.0 visual style.
- Use of color palate should be used to highlight points of interest
- Record this plan in `@prompts/6-web-user-ui-plan`
- Ensure you ask questions to help get the correct plan - however, I trust your capabilities to make decisions.
