> The prompt should:
> - ask the assistant to create a comprehensive plan that includes dependencies, file/folder structure, and architectural patterns.
> - recommend strict adherence to ALL of the details in this document.
> - strongly encourage the assistant to not add any additional dependencies without approval.
> - encourage the assistant to ask for more information if they need it.
